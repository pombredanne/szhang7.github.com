## Windows Commands
The command shell is a separate software program that provides direct communication between the user and the operating system. [Command-line reference A-Z](http://www.microsoft.com/resources/documentation/windows/xp/all/proddocs/en-us/ntcmds.mspx?mfr=true)

    %OS%                Returns the operating system name. Windows 2000 displays the operating system as Windows_NT.
    %COMPUTERNAME%      Returns the name of the computer.
    %USERNAME%          Returns the name of the user who is currently logged on.
    %DATE%              Returns the current date. Uses the same format as the date /t command. Generated by Cmd.exe.
    %TIME%              Returns the current time. Uses the same format as the time /t command. Generated by Cmd.exe. For more information about the time command, see Time
    %PATH%              Specifies the search path for executable files.
    %CD%                Returns the current directory string.

###call
Calls one batch program from another without stopping the parent batch program. The call command accepts labels as the target of the call. Call has no effect at the command-line when used outside of a script or batch file. 

    call [[Drive:][Path] FileName [BatchParameters]] [:label [arguments]]
 
    Parameters

    [Drive:][Path] FileName : Specifies the location and name of the batch program you want to call. The FileName parameter must have a .bat or .cmd extension.

    BatchParameters : Specifies any command-line information required by the batch program, including command-line options, file names, batch parameters (that is, %0 through %9), or variables (for example, %baud%).

    :label : Specifies the label to which you want a batch program control to jump. By using call with this parameter, you create a new batch file context and pass control to the statement after the specified label. The first time the end of the batch file is encountered (that is, after jumping to the label), control returns to the statement after the call statement. The second time the end of the batch file is encountered, the batch script is exited. For a description of the goto :eof extension that allows you to return from a batch script, see Related Topics.

    arguments : Specifies any command-line information that you pass to the new instance of the batch program that begins at :label, including command-line options, file names, batch parameters (that is, %1 through %9), or variables (for example, %baud%).

    /? : Displays help at the command prompt.

###ipconfig
Displays all current TCP/IP network configuration values and refreshes Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) and Domain Name System (DNS) settings. Used without parameters, ipconfig displays the IP address, subnet mask, and default gateway for all adapters.

    ipconfig [/all] [/renew [Adapter]] [/release [Adapter]] [/flushdns] [/displaydns] [/registerdns] [/showclassid Adapter] [/setclassid Adapter [ClassID]]

    Parameters

    /all : Displays the full TCP/IP configuration for all adapters. Without this parameter, ipconfig displays only the IP address, subnet mask, and default gateway values for each adapter. Adapters can represent physical interfaces, such as installed network adapters, or logical interfaces, such as dial-up connections.

    /renew [Adapter] : Renews DHCP configuration for all adapters (if an adapter is not specified) or for a specific adapter if the Adapter parameter is included. This parameter is available only on computers with adapters that are configured to obtain an IP address automatically. To specify an adapter name, type the adapter name that appears when you use ipconfig without parameters.

    /release [Adapter] : Sends a DHCPRELEASE message to the DHCP server to release the current DHCP configuration and discard the IP address configuration for either all adapters (if an adapter is not specified) or for a specific adapter if the Adapter parameter is included. This parameter disables TCP/IP for adapters configured to obtain an IP address automatically. To specify an adapter name, type the adapter name that appears when you use ipconfig without parameters.

    /flushdns : Flushes and resets the contents of the DNS client resolver cache. During DNS troubleshooting, you can use this procedure to discard negative cache entries from the cache, as well as any other entries that have been added dynamically.

    /displaydns : Displays the contents of the DNS client resolver cache, which includes both entries preloaded from the local Hosts file and any recently obtained resource records for name queries resolved by the computer. The DNS Client service uses this information to resolve frequently queried names quickly, before querying its configured DNS servers.

    /registerdns : Initiates manual dynamic registration for the DNS names and IP addresses that are configured at a computer. You can use this parameter to troubleshoot a failed DNS name registration or resolve a dynamic update problem between a client and the DNS server without rebooting the client computer. The DNS settings in the advanced properties of the TCP/IP protocol determine which names are registered in DNS.

    /showclassid Adapter : Displays the DHCP class ID for a specified adapter. To see the DHCP class ID for all adapters, use the asterisk (*) wildcard character in place of Adapter. This parameter is available only on computers with adapters that are configured to obtain an IP address automatically.

    /setclassid Adapter [ClassID] : Configures the DHCP class ID for a specified adapter. To set the DHCP class ID for all adapters, use the asterisk (*) wildcard character in place of Adapter. This parameter is available only on computers with adapters that are configured to obtain an IP address automatically. If a DHCP class ID is not specified, the current class ID is removed.

    /?: Displays help at the command prompt.

###net services

####Net services overview
Many services use networking commands that begin with the word net. These net commands have some common properties:

- You can see a list of all available net commands by typing net /? at a command prompt.
- You can get syntax help at the command line for a net command by typing net help command at a command prompt. For example, for help with the net accounts command, type the following:

    net help accounts
    
- All net commands accept /y (yes) and /n (no) command-line options. For example, the net stop server command prompts you to confirm that you want to stop all dependent Server services, while net stop server /y, by automatically answering yes, bypasses the confirmation prompt and shuts down the Server service.
- If a service name contains spaces, use quotation marks around the text (that is, "Service Name"). For example, the following command starts the net logon service:

    net start "net logon"

###Ping

Verifies IP-level connectivity to another TCP/IP computer by sending Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) Echo Request messages. The receipt of corresponding Echo Reply messages are displayed, along with round-trip times. Ping is the primary TCP/IP command used to troubleshoot connectivity, reachability, and name resolution. Used without parameters, ping displays help.

    ping [-t] [-a] [-n Count] [-l Size] [-f] [-i TTL] [-v TOS] [-r Count] [-s Count] [{-j HostList | -k HostList}] [-w Timeout] [TargetName]
    
    Parameters

    -t : Specifies that ping continue sending Echo Request messages to the destination until interrupted. To interrupt and display statistics, press CTRL-BREAK. To interrupt and quit ping, press CTRL-C.

    -a : Specifies that reverse name resolution is performed on the destination IP address. If this is successful, ping displays the corresponding host name.

    -n Count : Specifies the number of Echo Request messages sent. The default is 4.

    -l Size : Specifies the length, in bytes, of the Data field in the Echo Request messages sent. The default is 32. The maximum size is 65,527.

    -f : Specifies that Echo Request messages are sent with the Don't Fragment flag in the IP header set to 1. The Echo Request message cannot be fragmented by routers in the path to the destination. This parameter is useful for troubleshooting path Maximum Transmission Unit (PMTU) problems.

    -i TTL : Specifies the value of the TTL field in the IP header for Echo Request messages sent. The default is the default TTL value for the host. For Windows XP hosts, this is typically 128. The maximum TTL is 255.

    -v TOS : Specifies the value of the Type of Service (TOS) field in the IP header for Echo Request messages sent. The default is 0. TOS is specified as a decimal value from 0 to 255.

    -r Count : Specifies that the Record Route option in the IP header is used to record the path taken by the Echo Request message and corresponding Echo Reply message. Each hop in the path uses an entry in the Record Route option. If possible, specify a Count that is equal to or greater than the number of hops between the source and destination. The Count must be a minimum of 1 and a maximum of 9.

    -s Count : Specifies that the Internet Timestamp option in the IP header is used to record the time of arrival for the Echo Request message and corresponding Echo Reply message for each hop. The Count must be a minimum of 1 and a maximum of 4.

    -j HostList : Specifies that the Echo Request messages use the Loose Source Route option in the IP header with the set of intermediate destinations specified in HostList. With loose source routing, successive intermediate destinations can be separated by one or multiple routers. The maximum number of addresses or names in the host list is 9. The host list is a series of IP addresses (in dotted decimal notation) separated by spaces.

    -k HostList : Specifies that the Echo Request messages use the Strict Source Route option in the IP header with the set of intermediate destinations specified in HostList. With strict source routing, the next intermediate destination must be directly reachable (it must be a neighbor on an interface of the router). The maximum number of addresses or names in the host list is 9. The host list is a series of IP addresses (in dotted decimal notation) separated by spaces.

    -w Timeout : Specifies the amount of time, in milliseconds, to wait for the Echo Reply message that corresponds to a given Echo Request message to be received. If the Echo Reply message is not received within the time-out, the "Request timed out" error message is displayed. The default time-out is 4000 (4 seconds).

    TargetName : Specifies the destination, which is identified either by IP address or host name.

    /? : Displays help at the command prompt.

###Reg

Adds, changes, and displays registry subkey information and values in registry entries.

    reg add KeyName [/v EntryName|/ve] [/t DataType] [/s separator] [/d value] [/f]
    
    Parameters

    KeyName : Specifies the full path of the subkey. For remote computers, include the computer name before the path of the subkey in the \\ComputerName\PathToSubkey format. Omitting ComputerName causes the operation to default to the local computer. Start the path with the appropriate subtree. The valid subtrees are HKLM, HKCU, HKCR, HKU, and HKCC.

    /v EntryName : Specifies the name of the entry to be added under the specified subkey.

    /ve : Specifies that the entry that is added to the registry has a null value.

    /t DataType : Specifies the data type for the value of the entry. DataType can be one of the following:

    REG_SZ

    REG_MULTI_SZ

    REG_DWORD_BIG_ENDIAN

    REG_DWORD

    REG_BINARY

    REG_DWORD_LITTLE_ENDIAN

    REG_LINK

    REG_FULL_RESOURCE_DESCRIPTOR

    REG_EXPAND_SZ

    /s separator : Specifies the character used to separate multiple instances of data. Used when REG_MULTI_SZ is specified as the data type and more than one entry needs to be listed. If not specified, the default separator is \0.

    /d value : Specifies the value for the new registry entry.

    /f : Adds the subkey or entry without asking for confirmation.

    /?: Displays help at the command prompt.
