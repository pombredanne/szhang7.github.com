##Lecture Guidelines

It is a quick and simple way to present knowledge to large groups of trainees. here are some guidelines for presenting a lecture.
- Don't start out on the wrong foot.
- Give your listeners signals. For instance, if you have a list of items, start by saying something like, "There are four reasons why the sales reports are necessary...The first..."
- Be alert to your audience.
- Maintain eye contact with the audience during your presentation.
- Make sure everyone in the room can hear.
- Control your hands. Get in the habit of leaving them hanging naturally at your sides.
- Talk from notes rather than from a script. 
- Break along talk into a series of five-minute talks. Experts suggest breaking the long talk into a series of five-minute talks, each with its own introduction. Write more, briefer, PowerPoint slides, and spend about a minute on each. Each introduction highlights what you'll discuss, why it's important to the audience, and your credibility--why they should listen to you.
- Practice.
