The main purpose of this chapter is to show you how to develop a human resource management system that supports, and makes sense in terms of, your company's strategic aims; here we show how to translate a company's business strategy into actionable human resource policies and practices.

### THE STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT PROCESS

The essence of strategic planning is to ask "Where are we now as a business, where do we want to be, and how should we get ther?"

####Steps in Strategic Management

The entire 7-step strategic management process follows:

**Step 1: Define the Current Business**

Every company must choose the terrain on which it will compete--in particular ,what products it will sell, where it will sell them, and how it's products or services will differ from its competitors'.
The company's `vision` is "what we want to become", usually longer term, broader images.
Mission states to "who we are, what we do, and where we're headed."

**Step 2: Perform External and Internal Audits**

To facilitate strategic external/internal audit, many managers use SWOT analysis to compile and organize the process of identifying company Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats.

**Step 3: Formulate New Business and Mission Statements**

**Step 4: Translate the Mission into Strategic Goals**

**Step 5: Formulate Strategies to Achieve the Strategic Goals**

**Step 6: Implement the Strategies**

Strategy implementation means translating the strategies into actions and results--by actually hiring(or firing) people, building(or closing) plants, and adding(or eliminating)products and product lines.

**Step 7: Evaluate Performance**

Managing strategy is an ongoing process. Strategic control keeps the company's strategy up to date. It is the process of assessing progress toward strategic goals and taking corrective action as needed.

Strategies in a Nutshell

    Dell                Be direct
    eBay                Focus on trading communities
    General Electric    Be number one or number two in every industry in which we compete, or get out
    Southwest Airlines  Meet customers' short-haul travel needs at fares competitive with the cost of automobile travel
    Vanguard            Unmatchable value for the investor-owner
    Wal-Mart            Low prices, every day

####Types of Strategies

Three types of strategic planning: corporate strategy, competitive strategy, and functional strategy.

**Corporate Strategy**

Corporate-level strategy identifies the portfolio of business. There are several generic possibilities:

- A diversification coporate strategy implies that the firm will expand by adding new product lines.
- A vertical integration strategy means the firm expands by, perhaps, producing its own raw materials, or selling its products direct.
- Consolidation--reducing the company's size
- Geographic expansion--for instance, taking the business abroad

**Competitive Strategy**

We can define competitive advantages as any factors that allow a company to differentiate its product or service from those of its competitors to increase market share. to achieve competitive advantage:

- Cost leandership means the enterprise aims to become the low-cost leader in an industry.
- Differentiation. a firm seeks to be unique in its industry along dimensions that are widely valued by buyers.
- Focusers carve out a market niche, and compete by providing a product or service customers can get in no other way.

**Functional Strategy**

Functional strategies identify the basic courses of action that each department will pursue in order to help the business attain its competitive goals.

####Achieving Strategic Fit

There are two possibilities:
- Fit their capabilities to the oppotunities and threats
- Leverage resources--supplementing what you have and doing more with what you have

### HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT'S ROLE IN CREATING COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE

Operational flexibility is determined primarily by a plant's operators and the extent to which managers cultivate, measure, and communicate with them. Equipment and compuper integration are secondary. -- A production expert from Harvard University

`Toyota` Small teams of carefully selected and highly trained assembly workers inspecting and assessing their own work, selecting their own team members, interacting with engineers and suppliers to improve components, meeting with the plant's top managers, and spending several weeks each year being trained.

####Strategic Human Resource Management

It means formulating and executing human resource policies and practices that produce the employee competencies and bahaviors the company needs to achieve its strategic aims.

**Southwest Airlines**
An HR strategy built on high compensation, flexible job assignments, cross training, and employee stock ownership. We can outline this as follows: (1) high compensation, flexible work assignments, and so forth, lead to (2) motivated flexible ground crews and employees, who do whatever it takes to (3) turn the planes around in 15 minutes, so that (4) Southwest achieves its strategic aims of delivering low-cost, convenient service.

**Dell**
The essence of Dell's competitive strategy has always been to be a low-cost leader. Dell delivers most of its human resources services via the Web. Dell's intranet contains about 30 automated Web applications(including executive search reports, hiring tools, and automated employee referrals).

####Strategic Human Resource Challenges

Today's HR managers face three basic strategic challenges:

- One is the need to support corporate productivity and performance improvement efforts.
- Second, employees play an expanded role in employers' performance improvement efforts.
- The third challege is that employers see that their human resource units must be more involved in desgning--not just executing--the company's strategic plan.

### HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT'S STRATEGIC ROLES

Use metrics to measure the performance of human resources-related activities.

**How often do HR managers measure their depatment results?**

- Recruitment and selection processes(n=197)
- Performance management(n=196)
- Compensation management/reward programs(n=199)
- Benefits management(n=192)
- Employee relations(n=194)
- Health, safety and security programs(n=193)
- Budgeting(n=189)
- Retention programs(n=191)
- Employee communication programs(n=185)
- Diversity practices(n=188)
- Employee engagement initiatives(n=180)
- Analysis of trends and forecasting(n=180)
- Leadership development(n=187)
- Human capital measurements(n=175)
- Retirement planning(n=169)
- Talent management initiatives(n=176)
- Skills development initiatives(n=192)
- Work/life programs(n=171)
- Succession planning(n=174)
- Employment brand strategy/employment branding(n=161)
- Corporate social responsibility programs(n=156)

HR managers can play two basic strategic planning roles, in strategy execution and in strategy formulation.

####The Strategy Execution Role (traditional role)

HR manager designs strategies, policies, and practices that make sense in terms of the company's corporate and competitive strategies.

####The Strategy Formulation Role (expanded role)

HR manager need work with top management to formulate the company's strategic plans.

### CREATE THE STRATEGIC HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

Focus on three main components:

- The HR function: HR professionals with strategic management competencies
- The HR system: High Performance Work System (HPWS) consisting of strategically aligned HR policies, practices, and activities
- Employee behaviors: Employee competencies, values, motivation, and behaviors required by the company's strategic plan

####The High-Performance Work System

Multi-skilled work teams; empowered front-line workers; extensive training; labor management cooperation; commitment to quality; and customer satisfaction.

**Sample HR Practices**

- Number of qualified applications per position(Recruiting)
- Percentage hired based on a validated selection test
- Percentage of jobs filled from within
- Percentage in a formal HR plan including recruitment, development, and succession
- Number of hours of training for new employees(less than 1 year)
- Number of hours of training for experience employees
- Percentage of employees receiving a regular performance appraisal
- Percentage of workforce whose merit increase or incentive pay is tied to performance
- Percentage of workforce who received performance feedback from multiple sources(360)
- Target percentile for total compensation (market rate=50%)
- Percentage of the workforce eligible for incentive pay
- Percentage of difference in incentive pay between a low-performing and high-performing employee
- Percentage of the workforce routinely working in a self-managed, cross-functional, or project team
- Percentage of HR budget spent on outsourced activities(e.g., recruiting, benefits, payroll)
- Number of employees per HR professional
- Percentage of the eligible workforce covered by a union contract

**Firm Performance**

- Employee turnover
- Sales per employee
- Market value to book value

**Measuring HR's Effectiveness**

Such as revenue and income per full-time equivalent employee, average full-time employees overtime, the level of turnover and its associated costs, and overall human resource expenses.

####Translating Strategy into Human Resource Policy and Practice

**Basic Model of How to Align HR Strategy and Actions with Business Strategy**

- Formulate business strategy. "What are the strategic goals of the business?"
- Identify workforce requirments. "What employee competencies and behaviors must HR deliver to enable the business to reach its goals?"
- Formulate HR strategic policies and activities. "Which HR strategies and practices will produce these employee competencies and behaviors?"
- Develop detailed HR scorecard measures. "How can HR measure whether it is executing well for the business, in terms of producing the required workforce competencies and behaviors?"

The `HR Scorecard` is a concise measurement system, often summarized on a computer screen in a "digital dashboard".

### SUMMARY

1. In formulating their human resources strategies, HR managers must address three basic challenges: the need to support corporate productivity and performance improvement efforts; the fact that employees play an expanded role in the employer's performance improvement efforts; and the fact that HR must be more involved in designing--not just executing--the company's strategic plan.
2. There are seven basic steps in the strategic management process: Define the business and its mission; perform an external and internal audit; formulate new business and mission statements; translate the mission into strategic goals; formulate a strategy to achieve the strategic goals; implement the strategy; and evaluate performance.
3. There are three main types of strategic plans. The company's corporate-level strategy identifies the portfolio of businesses that in total comprise the company and includes diversification, vertical integration, consolidation, and geographic expansion. Each business needs a business level/competitive strategy: Differentiation and cost leadership are two examples. Finally, each individual business is composed of departments that require functional strategies. The latter identify the basic courses of action each department will pursue in order to help the business attain its strategic goals.
4. A strategy is a course of action. It shows how the enterprise will move from the business it is in now to the business it wants to be in, given its opportunities and threats and its internal strengths and weaknesses.
5. Strategic human resource management means formulating and executing HR systems that produce the employee competencies and behaviors the company requires to achieve its strategic aims.
6. The high-performance work system is designed to maximize the overall quality of human capital throughout the organization, and provides a set of benchmarks against which today's HR manager can compare the structure, content, and efficiency and effectiveness of his or her human resources system.
7. The basic process of aligning human resources strategies and actions with business strategy entails four steps: Formulate the business strategy; identify the workforce(employee) behaviors needed to produce the outcomes that will help the company achieve its strategic goals; formulate human resources strategic policies and actions to produce these employee behaviors; and develop measures (metrics) to evaluate the human resources department's performance.
8. The HR Scorecard process for creating a strategy-oriented human resources system, includes ten steps: Define the business strategy; outline the company's value chain; outline a strategy map; identify the strategically required organizational outcomes; identify the required workforce competencies and behaviors; identify the strategically relevant human resources system policies and activities; create HR Scorecard; design the HR Scorecard measurement system; summarize the Scorecard measures in a digital dashboard; and periodically evaluate the measurement system.
9. The HR Scorecard is a concise mearsurement system that shows the quantitative standards the firm uses to measure human resources activities, to measure the employee behaviors resulting from these activities, and to measure the strategically relevant organizational outcomes of those employee behaviors.

### APPENDIX A -- HR SCORECARD

####What Is an HR Scorecard?

The HR Scorecard is a concise measurement system, often summarized on a computer screen in a "digital dashboard". It shows the quantitative standards or "metrics" the firm use to measure HR activities, and to measure the employee behaviors resulting from these activities, and to measure the strategically relevant organizational outcomes of those employee behaviors.

####Information for Creating an HR Scorecard

To create an HR Scorecard, the manager needs three types of information: 

- what the company's strategy
- HR scorecard relationships
- metrics to measure all the activities and results involved

**The Basic HR Scorecard Relationships**

`HR activies`-->`Emergent employee behaviors`-->`Strategically relevant organizational outcomes`-->`Organizational performance`-->`Achieve strategic goals`

####The 10-Step HR Scorecard Process

&1. Define the Business Strategy
&2. Outline the Company's Value Chain    
The company's `value chain` identifies the primary activities that create value for customers and the related support activities.
3. Outline a Strategy Map    
A strategy map is a diagram that summarizes the chain of major inter-related activities that contribute to a company's success.
4. Identify the Strategically Required Organizational Outcomes
5. Identify the Required Workforce Competencies and Behaviors
6. Identify the Required HR System Policies and Activities
7. Create HR Scorecard
8. Choose HR Scorecard Measures
9. Summarize the Scorecard Measures in a Digital Dashboard    
a picture is worth a thousand words. -- the purpose of digital dashboard.    
For example, SAS software's Strategic Performance Management package is a web-based system that produces alerts that grab managers' attention when performance is not meeting targets.
10. Monitor, Predict, Evaluate

**Sample HR Performance Measures**

    - Employee commitment survey scores
    - Customer complaints/praise
    - Percentage of retention of high-performing key employees
    - Requests for transfer per employees
    - Percentage of employees making suggestions

    Sample measures for assessing HR system activities such as testing, training, and reward policies and practices

    - Number of hours of training employees receive each year
    - Proportion of merit pay determined by formal performance appraisal
    - Percentage of workforce regularly assessed via a formal performance appraisal
    - Percentage of employees eligible for annual merit cash or incentive plans
    - Extent to which information is communicated effectively to employees
    - Percentage of workforce who received a performance feedback from multiple sources
    - Percentage of difference in incentive pay between the low-performing and high-performing employees

####Automating Individual HR Tasks

As our company grows, it becomes increasingly unwieldy and uncompetitive to rely exclusively on manual HR systems. 
(International Association for Human Resource Information Management: <http://www.ihrim.org>)

####Establishing Human Resource Information Systems (HRIS)

**Why an HRIS**    
Larger companies typically integrate their separate HR systems into integrated human resource information systems(HRIS). There are at least three reasons for installing such a system.
- First is competitiveness; an HRIS can signigicantly improve the efficiency of the HR operation and therefore a company's bottom line.
- The HRIS can also bump the firm up to a new plateau in terms of the number and variety of HR-related reports it can produce.
- Finally, the HRIS can also help shift HR's attention from transactions-processing to strategic HR.

**HRIS in Action**    
Now, companys are moving from component systems(less than 1500employees) to integrated human resource information systems(larger firms).
The advantages are as the following:
- Improved Transaction Processing
- Online Processing
- Improved Reporting Capability
