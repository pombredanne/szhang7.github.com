The main purpose of this chapter is to provide you with an introductory overview of what human resource management is, and of why it is important to all managers. We'll see that human resource management activities such as hiring, training, compensating, appraising, and developing employees are part of every manager's job. And we'll see that human resource management is also a separate business function, usually with its own human resource or "HR" manager. The main topics we'll cover include the manager's human resource management jobs, global and competitive trends effecting human resource management, and how managers use modern human resource management methods to create high-performance companies and work systems.

####From Line Manager to HR Manager

### THE CHANGING ENVIRONMENT OF HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT

Changes are occuring today that are requiring human resource managers to play an increasingly central role in managing companies. These changes or trends include globalization, changes in the nature of work, and technology.

####Globalization Trends

Globalization is the tendency of firms to extend their sales, ownership, and/or manufacturing to new markets abroad.

Companies expand abroad for several reasons.
- Sales expansion is one.
- Some manufacturers seek new foreign products and services to sell, and to cut labor costs.

**Globalization's Implications**

- For business people, globalization's essential characteristic is this: More globalization means more competition, and more competition means more pressure to be "world-class"--to lower costs, to make employees more productive, and to do things better and less expensively.
- For consumers it means lower prices and higher quality on practically everything from computers to car to air travel, but also the prospect of working harder, and perhaps having less secure jobs.
- For business owners globalizing means benefits like reaching millions of new consumers, but also the considerable threat of facing new and powerful global competitors at home.

####Technological Trends

The Spanish retailer Zara operates its own Internet-based worldwide distribution network, linked to the checkout registers at its stores around the world.

####Trends in the Nature of Work

One implication is that technology has also had a huge impact on how people work, and on the skills and training today's workers need.

- High-Tech Jobs: For example, skilled machinist
- Service Jobs: global competition, just-in-time manufacturing techniques.
- Knowledge Work and Human Capital: require more education and more skills. Human capital refers to the knowledge, education, training, skills, and expertise of a firm's workers.

Nature of Work: Implications for HR. effective human resource management.

####Workforce Demographic Trends

At the same time, workforce demographic trends are making finding and hiring good employees more of a challenge. In the next few years, employers will face labor shortage.

### THE CHANGING ROLE OF HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT

With these trends, the human resource manager's job has grown broader and more strategic over time.

####Strategic Human Resource Management

**What Is Strategic Planning?**

A strategic plan is the company's plan for how it will match its internal strengths and weaknesses with external opportunities and threats in order to maintain a competitive advantage.
The essence of strategic planning is to ask, "Where are we now as a business, where do we want to be, and how should we get there?"

**What Is Strategic Human Resource Management?**

Strategic human resource management means formulating and executing human resource policies and pratices that produce the employee competencies and behaviors the company needs to achieve its strategic aims.

####Creating High-Performance Work Systems

**Top five business issues: competition for market share, price competition/price control, governmental regulations, need for sales growth, and need to increase productivity.**

Effective human resource management practices can improve performance in `three main ways`, in particular through the use of `technology`, through `effective human resource practices` (such as testing and training), and by instituting `high-performance work systems`.

**Managing with Technology**

Technological applications improve HR's performance in four main ways: self-service, call centers, productivity improvement, and outsourcing.

**Effective HR Practices**

For example, personality testing, well-trained employees.

**High-Performance Work Systems**

A high-performance work system is an integrated set of human resource management policies and practices that together produce superior employee performance.

High-performance work systems include these practices:

- employment security
- selective hiring
- extensive training
- self-managed teams and decentralized decision making
- reduced status distinctions between managers and workers
- information sharing
- contingent (pay-for-performance) rewards
- transformational leadership (for instance, in terms of inspirational motivation)
- measurement of management practices
- emphasis on high-quality work

####Measuring the Human Resource Management Team's Performance

The fundamental requirement for such measurability is that the human resource manager needs the numbers. Specifically, he or she needs quantitative performance measures (metrics).

**Five Sample HR Metrics**

    Absence rate = [(#Days absent in month)/(Average # of employees during mo.)*(# of workdays)]*100
    # Analyze why and how to address isue.

    Cost per hire = (Advertising+agency fees+employee referrals+travel cost of applications and staff+relocation costs+recruiter pay and benefits)/number of hires
    # Determine what your recruiting function can do to increase savings/reduce costs, and so on.

    HR expense factor = HR expense/total operating expense
    # Determine if expenditures exceeded, met, or fell below budget.

    Time to fill = Total days elapsed to fill requisitions/number hired
    # How efficient/productive is recruiting function?

    Turnover rate = [# of separations during mo./average # of employees during mo.]*100
    # Determine what organization can do to improve retention efforts.

####Managing with the HR Scorecard Process

The HR Scorecard is a concise measurement system.

### THE HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGER'S PROFICIENCIES

####Four Proficiencies

- HR proficiencies represent traditional knowledge and skills in areas such as employee selection, training, and compensation.
- Business proficiencies reflect human resource professionals' new strategic role.
- HR managers also require leadership proficiencies.
- Finally, the HR manager needs learning proficiencies.

####HR Certification

The Society for Human Resource Management's (SHRM) HR professional certification exams.
- SPHR(Senior Professional in HR) certificate
- PHR(Professional in HR) certificate

####Managing Ethics

Ethics refers to the standards someone uses to decide what his or her conduct should be.

### SUMMARY

1. All managers perform certain basic functions--planning, organizing, staffing, leading, and controlling. These represent the management process.
2. Staffing, personnel management, or human resource management includes activities like recruiting, selecting, training, compensating, appraising, and developing employees.
3. HR management is a part of every manager's responsibilities. These responsibilities include placing the right person in the right job, and then orienting, training, and compensating to improve his or her job performance.
4. The HR department carries out three main functions. The HR manager exerts line authority in his or her unit and implied authority elseshere in the organization. He or she ensures that the organization's HR objectives and policies are coordinated and implemented. And he or she provides various staff services to line management, such as partnering with the CEO in designing the company's strategy, and assisting in the hiring, training, evaluating, rewarding, promoting, and disciplining of employees at all levels.
5. Trends such as globalization, technological advances, and deregulation mean that companies must be more competitive today. Other important trends include growing workforce diversity and changes in the nature of work, such as the movement toward a service society and a growing emphasis on human capital.
6. For the HR manager, the focus on competitiveness and productivity demands measurability. Management expects HR to provide measurable, benchmark-based evidence regarding HR's current efficiency and effectiveness, and regarding the expected efficiency and effectiveness of its new or proposed programs.
7. HR managers often use HR Scorecards to facilitate the measurement process. The HR Scorecard is a visual and/or computerized model that enables managers to demonstrate how HR contributes to the company's financial success. It shows the measurable, cause-and-effect links between three things:(1) HR activities (such as improving the firm's incentive plan),(2)intermediate employee results (such as improved morale), and (3) end-result company metrics(such as improved customer service and higher profits).
8. In this book, several themes and features emphasize particularly important issues, and provide continuity from chapter to chapter. For example, HR management is the responsibility of every manager--not just those in the HR department. HR is a strategic partner in the strategy development process. HR works with other top managers to formulate the company's trategy as well as to execute it.
