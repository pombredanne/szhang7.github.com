The purpose of this chapter is to increase your effectiveness as a trainer. The main topics we'll cover include orienting employees, the training process, training methods, training for special purposes, managerial development and training techniques, and evaluating the training effort.

### ORIENTING EMPLOYEES

Carefully selecting employees doesn't guarantee they'll perform effectively. Even high-potential employees can't do their jobs if they don't know what to do or how to do it. The purpose of orienting and training employees is to ensure that your employees do know what to do and how to do.

####Purpose of Orientation
*Employee orientation* provides new employees with the basic background information they need to work in your company, such as information about company rules.

At a minimum, orientation should accomplish four things: The new employee should feel welcome and at ease; he or she should understand the organization in a broad sense(its past, present, culture, and vision of the future), as well as key facts such as policies and procedures; the employee should be clear about what is expected in terms of work and behavior; and the person should have begun the process of becoming socialized into the firm's ways of acting and doing things.

####The Orientation Process
The orientation typically includes information on employee benefits, personnel policies, the daily routine, company organization and operations, and safety measures and regulations, as well as a facilities tour.

**The employee Handbook**
The employee handbook's contents represent legally binding employment commitments.

### THE TRAINING PROCESS

*Training* means giving new or present employees the skills they need to perform their jobs.

####Training's Strategic Context
The firm's training programs must make sense in terms of the company's strategic goals.

**Performance Management**
means taking an integrated, goal-oriented approach to assigning, training, assessing, and rewarding employees' performance.

####The Five-Step Training and Development Process
Training programs consist of five steps:
1. The first, or needs analysis step, identifies the specific job performance skills needed, assesses the prospective trainees' skills, and devlops specific, measurable knowledge and performance objectives based on any deficiencies.
2. In the second step, instructional design, you decide on, compile, and produce the training program content, including workbooks, exercises, and activities.
3. There may be a third, validation step, in which the bugs are worked out of the training program by presenting it to a small representative audience.
4. The fourth step is to implement the program, by actually training the targeted employee group.
5. Fifth is an evaluation step, in which management assesses the program's successes or failures.

####Training, Learning, and Motivation
Training is futile if the trainee lacks the ability or motivation to benefit from it.

We can summarize movational points as follows.

**Make the Learning Meaningful**
It is easier for trainees to understand and remember material that is meaningful. Therefore:
1. At the start of training, provide a bird's-eye view of the material to be presented. Knowing the overall picture facilitates learning.
2. Use a variety of familiar examples.
3. Organize the information so you can present it logically, and in meaningful units.
4. Use terms and concepts that are already familiar to trainees.
5. Use as many visual aids as possible.

**Make Skills Transfer Easy**
Make it easy to transfer new skills and behaviors from the training site to the job site:
1. Maximize the similarity between the training situation and the work situation.
2. Provide adequate practice.
3. Label or identify each feature of the machine and/or step in the process.
4. Direct the trainees' attention to important aspects of the job.
5. Provide "heads-up," preparatory information.

####Motivation Principles for Trainers
1. People learn best by doing.
2. Trainees learn best when the trainers immediately reinforce correct responses, perhaps with a quick "well done".
3. Trainees lear best at their own pace.
4. Create a perceived training need in trainees' minds.
5. The schedule is important. The learning curve goes down late in the day.

####Analyzing Training Needs
How you analyze training needs depends on whether you're training new or current employees. The main task in analyzing new employees' training needs is to determine what the job entails and to break it down into subtasks, each of which you then teach to the new employee.

####Task Analysis: Assessing New Employees' Training Needs
Particularly with lower-level workers, it's common to hire inexperienced personnel and train them.

*Task analysis* is a detailed study of the job to determine what specific skills the job requires. Job description and job specifications are helpful here.

####Performance Analysis: Assessing Current Employees' Training Needs
For current employees, *performance analysis* is the process of verifying that there is a performance deficiency and determining if the employer should correct such deficiency through training or some other means(like transferring the employee).

**Can't Do/Won't Do**
It is futile to spend time training an employee whose work is deficient because of insufficient motivation. Distinguishing between can't-do and won't-do problems is thus the heart of performance analysis.

**Competency Models**
Many companies develop generic competency models for jobs or closely related groups of jobs. In this context, competency means knowledge, skills, and behaviors that enbale employees to effectively perform their jobs.

### TRAINING METHODS

Deciding on the actual content as well as on how to deliver the training--on-the-job, or via the Web, for instance.

####On-the-Job Training (OJT)
OJT means having a person learn a job by actually doing it.

**Types of On-the-Job Training**
Coaching or understudy method, an experienced worker or the trainee's supervisor trains the employee.

Job rotation, in which an employee moves from job to job at planned intervals.

**Advantages and Guidelines**

OJT Steps:

*Step 1: Prepare the Learner*
    1. Put the learner at ease.
    2. Explain why he or she is being taught.
    3. Create interest, find out the learner already knows about the job.
    4. Explain the whole job and relate it to some job the worker already knows.
    5. Place the learner as close to the normal working position as possible.
    6. Familiarize the worker with equipment, materials, tools, and trade terms.
    
*Step 2: Present the Operation*
    1. Explain quantity and quality requirements.
    2. Go through the job at the normal work pace.
    3. Go through the job at a slow pace several times, explain each step. Between operations, explain the difficult parts, or those in which errors are likely to be made.
    4. Again go through the job at a slow pace several times; explain the key points.
    5. Have the learner explain the steps as you go through the job at a slow pace.
    
*Step 3: Do a Tryout*
    1. Have the learner go through the job several times, slowly, explaining each step to you. Correct mistakes and, if neccessary, do some of the complicated steps the first few times.
    2. Run the job at the normal pace.
    3. Have the learner do the job, gradually building up skill and speed.
    4. As soon as the learner demonstrates ability to do the job, let the work begin, but don't abandon him or her.
    
*Step 4: Follow Up*
    1. Designate to whom the learner should go for help.
    2. Gradually decrease supervision, checking work from time.
    3. Correct faulty work patterns before they become a habit. Show why the learned method is superior.
    4. Compliment good work.
    
####Apprenticeship Training
*Apprenticeship training* is a process by which people become skilled workers, usually through a combination of formal learning and long-term on-the-job training.

####Informal Learning
performing their jobs on a daily basis in collaboration with their colleagues.

####Job Instruction Training
This step-by-step process is called *job instruction training(JIT)*.

####Lectures
It is a quick and simple way to present knowledge to large groups of trainees. here are some guidelines for presenting a lecture.
- Don't start out on the wrong foot.
- Give your listeners signals. For instance, if you have a list of items, start by saying something like, "There are four reasons why the sales reports are necessary...The first..."
- Be alert to your audience.
- Maintain eye contact with the audience during your presentation.
- Make sure everyone in the room can hear.
- Control your hands. Get in the habit of leaving them hanging naturally at your sides.
- Talk from notes rather than from a script. 
- Break along talk into a series of five-minute talks. Experts suggest breaking the long talk into a series of five-minute talks, each with its own introduction. Write more, briefer, PowerPoint slides, and spend about a minute on each. Each introduction highlights what you'll discuss, why it's important to the audience, and your credibility--why they should listen to you.
- Practice. 

####Programmed Learning
*Programmed learning* (or programmed instruction) is a step-by-step, self-learning method that consists of three parts:
1. Presenting questions, facts, or problems to the learner.
2. Allowing the person to respond.
3. Providing feedback on the accuracy answers.

Intelligent tutoring systems are basically computerized supercharged programmed instruction programs.

####Audiovisual-Based Training
Audiovisual-based training techniques like DVDs, films, PowerPoints, videoconferencing, audiotapes, and videotapes can be very effective and are widely used.

Consider using them in the following situations:
1. When there is a need to illustrate how to follow a certain sequence over time, such as when teaching fax machine repair.
2. When there is a need to expose trainees to events not easily demonstrable in live lectures, such as a visual tour of a factory or open-heart surgey.
3. When you need organizationwide training and it is too costly to move the trainers from place to place.

####Simulated Training
*Simulated training*(occasionally called vestibule training) is a method in which trainees learn on the actual or simulated equipment they will use on the job, but are actually trained off the job.

####Computer-Based Training (CBT)
With computer-based training, the trainee uses interactive computer-based and/or DVD systems to increase his or her knowledge or skills.

####Electronic Performance Support Systems (EPSS)
EPSS are computerized tools and displays that automate training, documentation, and phone support. They are modern job aids--a set of instructions, diagrams, or similar methods available at the job site to guide the worker.

####Distance and Internet-Based Training

**Teletraining** a trainer in a central location teaches groups of employees at remote locations via television hookups.

**Videoconferencing** allows people in one location to communicate live via a combination of audio and visual equipment with people in another city or country, or with groups in several cities.

####Internet-Based Training
Employers make extensive use of Web-based learning. Various products, like Blackboard and WebCT.

**The Virtual Classroom**
A virtual classroom uses special collaboration software to enable multiple remote learners, using their PCs or laptops, to participate in live audio and visual discussions, communicate via written text, and learn via content such as PowerPoint slides.

####Using E-Learning
In practice, it's usually not a choice of conventional versus online training. The trend is toward blended learning solutions.

**MP3/Instant Messaging**

####Improving Productivity Through HRIS: Learning Portals
Learning portal suppliers such as skillsoft.com contract with employers to deliver online training courses to the firms' employees. (See learnitivity.com for a list of commercial learning portals)

The movement today is toward integrating the e-learning system with the company's overall, enterprisewide information systems.

####Literacy Training Techniques
Functional illiteracy--the inability to handle basic reading, writing, and arithmetic tasks--is a serious problem at work.

### MANAGEMENT DEVELOPMENT

*Management development* is any attempt to improve managerial performance by imparting knowledge, changing attitudes, or increasing skills. The management development process consists of (1) assessing the company's strategic needs, (2) appraising managers' current performance, and then (3) developing the managers(and future managers).

**Research Insight**
"shatter the glass ceiling". leadership styles: the trend toward high-involvement work teams, consensus decision making, and empowerment.

**Succession Planning**
refers to the process through which a company plans for and fills senior-level openings.

The typical succession planning process involves several steps: 

First, anticipate management needs based on strategic factors like planned expansion.

Next, review your firm's management skills inventory to assess current talent.

Then, create replacement charts that summarize potential candidates and each person's development needs.

####Managerial On-the-Job Training
Managerial on-the-job training methods include job rotation, the coaching/understudy approach, and action learning.

**Job Rotation**
means moving management trainees from department to department to broaden their understanding of all parts of the business and to test their abilities.

**Coaching/Understudy Approach**
Here the trainee works directly with a senior manager or with the person he or she is to replace; the latter is responsible for the trainee's coaching.

**Action Learning**
give managers and others released time to work full-time analyzing and solving problems in departments other than their own.

####Off-the-Job Management Training and Development Techniques
**The Case Study Method**
presents a trainee with a written description of an organizational problem. The person then analyzes the case, diagnoses the problem, and presents his or her findings and solutions in a discussion with other trainees.

**Management Games**
With computerized management games, trainees divide into five- or six-person groups, each of which competes with the others in a simulated marketplace.

**Outside Seminars**
Many companies and universities offer Web-based and traditional classroom management development seminars and conferences. (American Management Association, SHRM)

**University-Related Programs**
Many universities provide executive education and continuing education programs in leadership, supervision, and the like. The Advanced Management Program of the Graduate School of Business Administration at Harvard University is a well-known example.

**Role Playing**
The aim of role playing is to create a realistic situation and then have the trainees assume the parts (or roles) of specific persons in that situation.

**Behavior Modeling**
involves (1) showing trainees the right (or "model") way of doing something, (2) letting trainees practice that way, and then (3) giving feedback on the trainees' performance.

The basic procedure is as follows:
1. Modeling.
2. Role playing.
3. Social reinforcement
4. Transfer of training.

Firms don't use behavior modeling just for teaching supervisory-type skills.

**Corporate Universities**
Many firms, particularly larger ones, establish in-house development centers(often called corporate universities). GE, McDonalds, IBM.

**The SHRM Learning System**
SHRM, the Society for Human Resource Management, encourages HR professionals to qualify for certification by taking examinations.

####Creating Your Own Training Program
using the following process:

**Step 1. Set Training Objectives**

**Step 2. Write a Detailed Job Description**

**Step 3. Develop an Abbreviated Task Analysis Record Form**

**Step 4. Develop a Job Instruction Sheet**

**Step 5. Prepare Training Program for the Job**

### MANAGING ORGANIZATIONAL CHANGE AND DEVELOPMENT

Helping firms manage change is a major issue for human resource managers.

####What to Change
Organizational renewal often starts with a change in the firm's strategy, mission, and vision--with strategic change.

Strategic, cultural, structural, and technological changes like these, no matter how logical, will fail without the active support of a motivated and competent workforce.

**The Human Resource Manager's Role**
At a minimum, this includes understanding three things--how to overcome resistance to change, how to organize and lead an organizational change, and how to use a technique known as organizational development.

####Overcoming Resistance to Change: Lewin's Change Process
Often, the trickiest part of implementing an organizational change is overcoming employees' resistance to it.

Psychologist Kurt Lewin formulated the classic explanation of how to implement change in the face of resistance. Lewin's change process consisted of these three steps:
1. Unfreezing. means reducing the forces that are striving to maintain the status quo.
2. Moving. means developing new behaviors, values, and attitudes.
3. Refreezing. institute new systems and procedures (such as new compensation plans and appraisal processes) to support and maintain the changes.

####How to Lead the Change
We can summarize these as follows.

**Unfreezing Phase**
- Establish a sense of urgency.
- Mobilize commitment through joint diagnosis of problems.

**Moving Phase**
- Create a guiding coalition.
- Develop and communicate a shared vision. The key elements: keep it simple, use multiple forums, use repetition, lead by example.
- Help employees make the change.
- Consolidate gains and produce more change.

**Refreezing Phase**
- Reinforce the new ways of doing things with changes to the company's systems and procedures.
- Finally, the leader must monitor and assess progress.

####Using Organizational Development
*Organizational development* is an approach to organizational change in which the employees themselves formulate the change that's required and implement it, often with the assistance of a trained consultant. OD has several distinguishing characteristics:
1. It usually involves action research.
2. It applies behavioral science knowledge to improve the organization's effectiveness.
3. It changes the organization in a particular direction--toward improved problem solving, responsiveness, quality of work, and effectiveness.

There are four basic categories of OD applications: human process, technostructural, human resource management, and strategic applications.

**Human Process Applications**
aim first at improving human relations skills. Sensitivity, laboratory, or t-group training's basic aim is to increase the participant's insight into his or her own behavior by encouraging an open expression of feelings in the trainer-guided t-group. Survey research requires that employees througout the organization complete attitude surveys.

**Technostructural Interventions**
OD practitioners are involved in changing firms' structures, methods, and job designs, using an assortment of technostructural interventions.

**Human Resource Management Applications**
OD practitioners are action research to enable employees to analyze and change their firm's human resources practices.

**Strategic OD Applications**
Strategic interventions are organizationwide OD programs aimed at achieving a fit among a firm's strategy, structure, culture, and external environment.

### EVALUATING THE TRAINING EFFORT

There are basically three things you can measure: participants's reactions to the program; what the trainees learned from the program; and to what extent their on-the-job behavior changed as a result of the program.

####Designing the Study
How to design the evaluation study. The time series is one option. Controlled experimentation is a second option.

####Training Effects to Measure
You can measure four basic categories of training outcomes:
1. Reaction.
2. Learning.
3. Behavior.
4. Results.

### SUMMARY

1. The training process consists of five steps: needs analysis, instructional design, validation, implementation, and evaluation.
2. Principles of learning that are useful for training include: Make the material meaningful (by providing a bird's-eye view and familiar examples, organizing the material, splitting it into meaningful chunks, and using familiar terms and visual aids); make provition for transfer of training; and try to motivate trainees.
3. Basic training methods include on-the-job training, apprenticeship training, informal learning, job instruction training, lectures, programmed learning, audiovisual tools, simulated training, computer-based training, electronic performance support systems, and distance and Internet-based training.
4. On-the-job training is a common training technique. It might take the form of the understudy method, job rotation, or special assignments and committees. In any case, it should have four steps: preparing the learner, presenting the operation (or nature of the job), doing performance tryouts, and following up.
5. Management development prepares employees for future jobs by imparting knowledge, changing attitudes, or increasing skills.
6. Managerial on-the-job training methods include job rotation, coaching, and action learning. Basic off-the-job techniques include case studies, management games, outside seminars, university-related programs, role playing, behavior modeling, and in-house development centers.
7. In gauging the effectiveness of a training program, there are four categories of outcomes companies can measure: reactions, learning, behavior, and results. In some cases where training seems to have failed, it may be because training was not the appropriate solution to the problem.
